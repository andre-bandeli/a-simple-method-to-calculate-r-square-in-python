### Coefficient of Determination (\( R^2 \))

The coefficient of determination, commonly denoted by \( R^2 \), is a statistical metric that quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the regression model. The value of \( R^2 \) ranges from 0 to 1, where:

- **\( R^2 = 1 \)**: Indicates that the model explains all the variance in the observed data, suggesting a perfect fit.
- **\( R^2 = 0 \)**: Indicates that the model explains none of the variance beyond the mean of the observed data.
- **\( R^2 < 0 \)**: Suggests that the regression model performs worse than simply using the mean of the observed values.

A higher \( R^2 \) value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. This metric is widely used to assess the quality of fit in regression models.

In this case study, the data used were observed and forecast precipitation values to evaluate the ETA/CPTEC Model.
